Conventions
---------

For the most part, Gramurn names can be defined in a few general conventions. These are the paradigms for forming an Individual Adult Name, a Family or Clan Name, a Place Name, and an Artifact name.

### Adult Name ###

The Adult name is the name most Gramurn use for the majority of their life. This name is granted or adopted sometime between the first hunt and the first rut, and is usually a unique combination within both the clan and the tribe.

Adult names consist of two words inflected to create a descriptive statement of some sort. Most often these forms can be read as Noun + Adjective, but there are many ways to form such a name within the vocabulary of GNL.

Depending on the clan in which a Gramurn lives, they may have more or less freedom in their adult name. Some clans are very traditional and have ritual ceremonies in which an elder ends up assigning the adult name, while others allow a young adult to declare their own name. Regardless of what procedure is used, names are kept in clan manors and tribal records, and are not recognized until both the named and a clan or tribal elder have verified the adult name.

The two names of an adult Gramurn are said to reflect the male and female aspects of the soul, and the name most used reflects the primary aspect of the Gramurn, most often identified by their biological sex or gender. In this structure, the Male name is the first name, usually the key component of the composed name, while the Female name is second, usually the descriptive or meaning-altering component of the composed name.

* As an example, _kharon alpua_ is a composed name. In this name, _kharon_ is the male name, meaning 'hunter.' By extension, 'alpua' is the female name, meaning 'swift.' The composed name means 'swift hunter' and the common name for an adult bearing this name would depend on whether they are male or female.
