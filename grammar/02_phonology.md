Phonology
---------

While the modern pronunciations are not reflective of the language spoken 600
years ago, the roots used in GNL are preserved in a separate form from the roots
as spoken in daily speech. As such, words in GNL behave differently from those
in modern Gramurn languages. Also, GNL is a nearly universal feature of the
Gramurn languages, with little deviation from the form presented here.

GNL does not treat trills as phonemic, they are allophones of their respective
consonants as listed here:

- /м/ is an allophone of /m/
- /ʙ/ is an allophone of /bv/
- /ŧ/ is an allophone of /t/ and /ts/
- /đ/ is an allophone of /d/ and /dz/
- /к/ is an allophone of /k/ and /x/
- /г/ is an allophone of /g/, /ɣ/, and /ɰ/
- /ʀ/ is an allophone of /ɹ/, /ɾ/, /r̥/, /r/, and /ʁ/

### Vowels ###
> ```
> i i u u u
> i i e u u
> i e e o o
> a a e e o
> a a a a a
> ```

GNL has a five-vowel system, and the above table maps the ranges which are most
generally associated with each vowel. In addition to the five pure vowels, there
are also five diphthong vowels: /ae/, /ai/, /ei/, /eu/, /ou/.

In addition to the diphthongs, Gramurn languages typically use vowel length. In
some of the Gramurn languages, tones are present. GNL only distinguishes length
of vowels as phonemic, though the various Gramurn languages and dialects may
have variants of GNL which include their local language features.

Transcription
-------------

This document will include two forms of transcription for GNL. The first is the
use of IPA transcription as outlined above. The second is an Extended Latin
transliteration scheme meant to reflect underlying forms more than phonetic
forms. Note that any symbols which are not mentioned below are used as-is.

### Consonants ###

- IPA /ɱ/ is represented as /m{pbfv}/
- IPA /ɲ/ is represented as /gn/ or /ñ/ (where diacritics are supported)
- IPA /ŋ̊/ is represented as /nk/
- IPA /ŋ/ is represented as /ng/
- IPA /pf/ is represented as /p/ or /f/
- IPA /bv/ is represented as /b/ or /w/
- IPA /tʃ/ is represented as /ch/
- IPA /dʒ/ is represented as /dj/
- IPA /ʃ/ is represented as /sh/
- IPA /ʒ/ is represented /j/
- IPA /ʝ/ is represented /c/ (but only when not followed by /h/ as noted above)
- IPA /ɣ/ is represented /gh/
- IPA /χ/ is represented /kh/
- IPA /ʁ/ is represented /rh/
- IPA /ɹ/ is represented /r/
- IPA /ɻ/ is represented /ry/
- IPA /j/ is represented /y/
- IPA /ɰ/ is represented /gw/
- IPA /ɾ/ is represented /r'/
- IPA /ɢ̆/ is represented /g'/
- IPA /ɮ/ is represented /lj/
- IPA /ʎ̝̊/ is represented /xy/
- IPA /ʎ̟/ is represented /ll/
- IPA /ʎ/ is represented /ly/
- IPA /ɺ/ is represented /l'/
- IPA /ʎ̯/ is represented /hy/

Gramurn does not allow consonant clusters in roots, so the clusters in transcriptions should be always recognized in this context. Gramurn languages are usually written with an ideographic script, so they have no concept of _letters_ or _letter clusters_ in their native experience.

### Vowels ###

Vowels are more straightforward - they are written once in their neutral state
and twice when they are long. Diphthongs may incorporate a long vowel in one,
but not both, of their positions.

Syllable Structure
------------------

While it may have been more complex when it was contemporary, GNL in modern usage has a fairly simple syllable structure in roots: `(C)V(V)(C)`.

Each root may begin with a single consonant, must have a single vowel (whether it is a single vowel or a diphthong), may have a second vowel, and may end in an additional consonant -- which may not be the same consonant with which it began.

Roots are always a single, complete syllable, with glottal stops at either end if necessary only once the derivation process goes to work. Other syllables are defined a bit more loosely, but are almost always `(C)V(C)`,  with only a few exceptions - usually old diphthongs which are no longer used as diphthongs.
